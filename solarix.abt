Solarix Operating System
=========================

Solarix is a lightweight 32-bit graphical operating system built from scratch.
It uses a custom kernel, boots via GRUB, and initializes a VESA framebuffer
to draw a simple GUI window environment.

Key Features:
- Custom kernel written in C and Assembly
- VESA-compatible GUI (1024x768, 32-bit color)
- Framebuffer graphics: windows, color fills, and more
- Boots in under 1 second via QEMU

Requirements:
- i686-elf cross-compiler toolchain
- GRUB 2 and grub-mkrescue for ISO generation
- QEMU or a virtual machine for testing
